# Edge-GL

A WebGL port of my 3D terrain generator.

Before I entered the web industry, I was trying to write my own game engine in C++ OpenGL.

I've been itching to work with OpenGL again, and WebGL lets me do that using the same tools I use
in the web industry (with a lot less boilerplate code needed).

I am doing this open source in the hopes it helps someone get into OpenGL programming.
